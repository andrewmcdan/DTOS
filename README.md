# Digital Tactical Open Source Radio (DTOS) Project Overview
## Purpose
The DTOS project aims to create an advanced, open-source communications platform designed specifically for use by military, paramilitary, civilian militia, and emergency services personnel who lack the backing of well-financed organizations. This initiative seeks to provide an affordable alternative to expensive proprietary radios, democratizing access to high-quality tactical communication tools.

## Target Audience
- Military
- Paramilitary
- Civilian Militia
- Emergency Services Personnel

## Technical Specifications
Core Processor: Raspberry Pi 4B (standard specifications), with modifications to remove through-hole connectors for a lower profile.
Backup and System Management: Teensy 4.1 microcontroller.
Communication Modes: VHF/UHF, 900MHz LoRa, 2.4GHz and 5GHz WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS.
Connectivity: Support for IP devices (laptops, cellphones), K1 connector for headsets, USB-C for charging and data.
Future Functionalities
Encryption
Interoperability with standard two-way radios
Weather radio reception
Design Considerations
Durability: The device will be encased in machined billet aluminum for ruggedness and heat dissipation.
Dimensions: Approximately 3in x 1.6in x 6in (excluding the battery). The battery will extend the length by an additional 4 inches.
Challenges
The primary challenge lies in the solo development phase, which requires extensive work to reach a working prototype. The project's success depends on effective time management and potentially expanding the development team to accelerate progress.
